# BLM Digital Art Gallery - Ecommerce for art

Full-stack digital art gallery built with React, Redux, Node and MongoDB (MERN) stack.

## Goals
As members of a social impact club, we hope to contribute to the Black Lives Matter Movement through selling our digital artworks to raise funds. 100% of funds are donated to local non-profits that directly serve, uplift, and organize for Black communities in the Bay Area and beyond. 

This gallery was created through the contributions of over a dozen artists within Invention Corps. We began developing the site since last July and are so grateful to finally share this gallery with our community. We have democratically selected non-profits that we feel are actively addressing racial injustice through youth empowerment, health, and community-oriented initiatives. We hope you can explore the gallery and find pieces that inspire and reasonate with you. Thank you for your support.
