            Recognizing the ongoing tensions as part of an enduring history of
            racial injustice is only the first step. We, as an organization for
            social impact, would like to devote our responsibility toward and
            state our solidarity in uplifting and supporting Black communities.
            The loss of innocent Black lives like George Floyd, Breonna Taylor,
            Ahmaud Arbery, Jake Blake, and many more whose names deserve to be
            remembered is deeply felt. May they Rest In Power.

            Given that the rampant and obvious police brutality against Black
            citizens is only a single facet of the extensive systems of
            oppression we are fighting against, we would like to add to the
            reparations owed to a variety of Black communities by donating the
            proceeds from our collective artwork to the selection of non-profits
            that are committed to justice and equity as well below. We realize
            it is not enough to denounce police brutalityâ€”it is equally crucial
            to oppose educational, employment, housing, health, and voting
            discrimination that remains present across this nation. Let this be
            a reminder that the fight for a truly equitable future is a
            persistent practice of un-learning, decolonizing, advocacy, and
            action.

            This gallery was created through the contributions of over a dozen
            artist within Invention Corps. We began developing the site since
            last July and are so grateful to finally share this gallery with our
            community. We have democratically selected non-profits that we feel
            are actively addressing racial injustice through youth empowerment,
            health, and community-oriented initiatives. We hope you can explore
            the gallery and find pieces that inspire and reasonate with you.
